            <h4>Elevator Pitch</h4>
            <p>
                The Elevator Pitch app was designed for use by a pacific northwest sportswear company to give its employees a tool to help them tackle the vast amount of information on their products and IPs, allowing them to communicate about them accurately and keep accidental information leaks at a minimum. This app broke down the companyâ€™s information into 30 second, 2 minute, and 15 minute formats, so all employees from entry level stocking employees to executives could see information in a way that is relevant to them. This app was developed for android phones using C++ with the android SDK. Due to relatively simple nature of the app and the demanding data security requirements, the face of the app was made without any external libraries and connected to the client database with a secured REST API. During development and testing, a cloud hosted MySQL database was set up using cleaned data provided by the company. Upon release, the REST API was connected to their self-hosted and maintained database.
